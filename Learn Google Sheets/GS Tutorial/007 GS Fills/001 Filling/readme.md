Filling
---
Filling makes your life easier and is used to fill ranges with values, so that you do not have to manually type the entries.

Filling can be used for:


- Copying
- Sequences
- Dates
- Functions


**Note:** For now, do not think of functions. We will cover that in a later chapter.


How To Fill
---
Filling is done by selecting a cell, clicking the fill icon and selecting the range using drag and mark while holding the left mouse button down.

The fill icon is found in the button right corner of the cell and has the icon of a small square. Once you hover over it your mouse pointer will change its icon to a thin cross.

Click the fill icon and hold down the left mouse button, drag and mark the range that you want to cover.

In this example, cell `A1` was selected and the range `A1:A10` was marked.

Now that we have learned how to fill. Let's look into how to copy with the fill function.



Fill Copies
---
Filling can be used for copying. It can be used for both numbers and words.

Let's have a look at numbers first.

In this example we have typed the value `A1(1)`:

Filling the range `A1:A10` creates ten copies of 1:

he same principle goes for text.

In this example we have typed `A1(Hello World)`.

Filling the range `A1:A10` creates ten copies of "Hello World":

Now you have learned how to fill and to use it for copying both numbers and words. Let's have a look at sequences.
