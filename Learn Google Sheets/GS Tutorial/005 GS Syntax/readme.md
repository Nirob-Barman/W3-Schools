Syntax

A formula in Google Sheets is used to do mathematical calculations. Formulas always start with the equal sign = typed in the cell, followed by your calculation.


**Note**: You claim the cell by selecting it and typing the equal sign (`=`)


Creating formulas, step by step
---
- Select a cell
- Type the equal sign (=)
- Select a cell or type a value
- Enter an arithmetic operator
- Select another cell or a type value
- Press Enter


For example =1+1 is the formula to calculate 1+1=2

**Note:** The value of a cell is communicated by **reference(value)** for example `A1(2)` means the cell `A1` has value `2`.



Using Formulas with Cells
---
You can type values to cells and use them in your formulas.

Lets type some dummy values to get started. Double click the cells to type values into them. Go ahead and type:

- `A1(309)`
- `A2(320)`
- `B1(39)`
- `B2(35)`
