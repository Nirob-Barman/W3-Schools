Google Sheets Parentheses

Parentheses
Parentheses () are used to change the order of an operation.

Using parentheses makes Google Sheets do the calculation for the numbers inside the parentheses first, before calculating the rest of the formula.

Parentheses are added by typing () on both sides of numbers, like (1+2).

Examples
No parentheses

=10+5*2

The result is 20 because it calculates 10+10

With parentheses

=(10+5)*2

The result is 30 because it calculates (15)*2

Formulas can have groups of parentheses.

=(10+5)+(2*4)+(4/2)

Note: Cells can be used as values in the formulas inside parentheses, like =(A1+A2)*B5. We have used manual entries in our examples to keep things simple.
