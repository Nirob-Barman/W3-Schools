First, let's start with explaining the **Ribbon**.


The Ribbon explained
---
The **Ribbon** provides shortcuts to Google Sheets commands. A command is an action that allows you to make something happen. This can for example be to: insert a chart, change the font size, or to change the color of a cell.

The **Ribbon** is made up of the **Sheets Home, Menu bar, Quick Access Toolbar, Groups and Commands**. In this section we will explain the different parts of the **Ribbon**.

Sheets Home
The Sheets Home button takes you to Google Sheets start page where you can create new workbooks or visit your Previous workbooks.

Menu Bar
The menu bar allows you to perform different actions on your workbook.

Quick Access Toolbar
The quick access toolbar has the most popular actions from the menu.

Groups
The groups are sets of related commands on the quick access toolbar. The groups are separated by the thin vertical line break.

Commands
The commands are the buttons that you use to do actions.

Now, let's have a look at the Sheet. Soon you will be able to understand the relationship between the Ribbon and the Sheet, and you can make things happen.
