Delete Cells

Cells can be deleted by selecting them, and pressing the **Delete** button on the keyboard.

**Note:** The delete function will not delete the formatting of the cell, just the value inside of it.

Let's have a look at three examples.

Note that it only deletes the value in the cells, and not the formatting (the color).

**Note:** You will learn more about formatting, and how to style cells in a later chapter.
