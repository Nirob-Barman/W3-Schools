AND Function
---
The **AND** function is a premade function in Google Sheets, which returns **TRUE** or **FALSE** based on two or more conditions.

It is typed `=AND` and takes two or more conditions.

<pre>
    =AND(<b>[logical_expression1], [logical_expression2, ...]</b>)
</pre>


The conditions are referred to as `[logical_expression1]`, `[logical_expression2]`, and so on.

The conditions can check things like:

If a number is **greater than** another number `>`
If a number is **smaller than** another number `<`
If a number or text is **equal** to something `=`


<pre>
<b>Note</b>: The AND function is often used together with the IF function.
