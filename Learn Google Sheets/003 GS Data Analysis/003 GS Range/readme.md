Sort Range By Column
---
Google sheet lets you sort data in a range by columns

It is possible to sort data in a sheet by range.

**Note:** To sort a range that has more than one column, the whole range of data has to be selected. Sorting just one can breaks the relationship between columns.

This is shown in an example later in this chapter.

The sort commands can be found in the **Data** menu.

1. Select the range `A2:A21`


**Note:** A1 is not included as it is the header for the column. This is the row that is dedicated to the filter. Including it will blend it with the rest.

2. Click on the **Data** menu and select **Sort range by column A, A → Z**

Try again, this time with **Sort range by column A, Z → A** to see what that looks like!
