Google Sheets Conditional Formatting

Conditional Formatting
---

Conditional formatting is used to change the **appearance** of cells in a range based on your specified **conditions**.

The conditions are rules based on specified numerical values, matching text and more.

```
Changing the appearance of cells can visually highlight interesting data points for analysis.
```

Google Sheet provides a number of preset formatting options, as well as customizable format options and conditions.

The two main Conditional Formatting options are:

1. Single Color
2. Color Scale

**Single Color** formatting applies a single customizable formatting option to all the cells that match a condition.

**Color Scale** formatting applies a background color that smoothly changes between 2 or 3 colors based on the values of cells in a range.


**Note**: Single Color formatting lets you customize **both** the background color and the font in the cells.
