Range is an important part of Google Sheets because it allows you to work with selections of cells.

There are four different operations for selection;

* Selecting a cell
Selecting multiple cells
Selecting a column
Selecting a row
Before having a look at the different operations for selection, we will introduce the Name Box.

The Name Box
The Name Box shows you the reference of which cell or range you have selected. It can also be used to select cells or ranges by typing their coordinates.
