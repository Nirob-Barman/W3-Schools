Google Sheets has columns and rows, similar to a squared math exercise book.



Do not worry if the functionality looks overwhelming at first. You will get comfortable as you learn more in the chapters to come.

For now focus on the rows, columns, and the cells.

* Second, type `=1+1`.
* Third, hit the `Enter` button:

**Congratulations!** You have typed your first function, **1+1=2.**
